# Longest-Common-Subsequence
Aim: Implement Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find the length and LCS
for DNA sequences.

Problem Statement:
DNA sequences can be viewed as strings of A, C, G, and T characters, which represent
nucleotides. Finding the similarities between two DNA sequences are an important
computation performed in bioinformatics.
[Note that a subsequence might not include consecutive elements of the original sequence.]

TASK-1: Find the similarity between the given X and Y sequence.
X=AGCCCTAAGGGCTACCTAGCTT
Y= GACAGCCTACAAGCGTTAGCTTG
Output: Cost matrix with all costs and direction, final cost of LCS and the LCS.
LCS is:

TASK-2: Find the longest repeating subsequence (LRS). Consider it as a variation of the
longest common subsequence (LCS) problem.
Let the given string be S. You need to find the LRS within S. To use the LCS framework, you
effectively compare S with itself. So, consider string1 = S and string2 = S.
Example:
AABCBDC
LRS= ABC or ABD
